## Requirements

The Unfiltered Theme requires the Genesis Framework which can be purchased at http://www.studiopress.com/.

## Terms of Use

**The Unfiltered Theme does not include support.**

In an attempt to pay it forward, I decided to make this theme free to download. I poured my heart and soul into this design, so please respect the decision to make it available by using it "as is."

I'll be updating this theme frequently, so it's up to you to identify any changes and apply them on your own.

**I reserve the right to modify these terms or remove the theme entirely from GitHub at my discretion.**

## Theme Setup

The Unfiltered Theme was meant to be simple. Some functionality of the Genesis Framework has been removed.

**Site Title**

Simply add a text widget into the Header Right widget area. Below is the code that I've used on my own blog:

```
<h1 class="site-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://unfiltered.me/" title="Unfiltered"><span class="un">Un</span><span class="filtered">filtered</span></a></h1>
```

**Menu**

All you need to do is create a custom menu and add that in the Header Right widget area after the text widget that I mentioned above for the site title.

**Web Fonts**

The fonts that are being called in the theme style sheet are from Typekit (https://typekit.com/fonts) -- which means you'll need to replace them (with Google Fonts) or default browser fonts will show.
